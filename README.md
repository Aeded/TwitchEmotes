# TwitchEmotes
Not compatible with TBC Classic
Enables Twitch Emotes for chat (and more)



This addon does not have any ingame customization/preview of the emotes. Someday I might add such features.

Addon ignores upper and lower case letters, you are able to type FeelsBadMan or just feelsbadman or even FeLSbADMan. To see the emotes
you can browse the addonÂ´s directory and its files. 

If you want to show a WoW ability as icon you type [ic][name of ablity] like this: icmortalstrike.
